# GalacticGregGT5
The rewritten GalacticGreg mod for GregTech5

This mod:

- is not compatible with GregTech 6
- is not compatible with GalacticGreg-Config settings created prior to this mod
- is still WiP (Not anymore!)
- is not maintained by BloodAsp, so don't contact him about bugs, use the issue tracker here
- has (or will soon have, once I overcome my laziness) a decent documentation (See Github Wiki)

You can build it for yourself, but if you just feel lazy (As I do most times), feel free to grab a compiled version
for either master (will try to keep that branch stable) or dev (cutting edge features!) here:

Master: [![Build Status](http://jenkins.usrv.eu:8081/buildStatus/icon?job=GalacticGreg GT5)](http://jenkins.usrv.eu:8081/job/GalacticGreg%20GT5/)
Dev: [![Build Status](http://jenkins.usrv.eu:8081/buildStatus/icon?job=GalacticGreg GT5 - DeveloperBranch)](http://jenkins.usrv.eu:8081/job/GalacticGreg%20GT5%20-%20DeveloperBranch/)
